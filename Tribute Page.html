      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 300%;">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century.Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews.His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.</p>
